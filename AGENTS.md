# AGENTS

## Working Rules

- Keep `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` up to date throughout implementation work.
- Keep a current `Development Requirements` section in `README.md` (tooling, versions, and setup commands).
- Mark each task as `In Progress` in `docs/001-plan.md` when starting it.
- Update `docs/001-plan.md` progress continuously so work can be resumed easily.
- Keep `docs/001-plan.md` statuses current as tasks are completed or blocked.
- Do not make changes outside this repository.
- Make small, focused git commits as milestones are completed.
