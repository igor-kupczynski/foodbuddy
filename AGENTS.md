# AGENTS

## Working Rules

- Keep `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` up to date throughout implementation work.
- Keep a current `Development Requirements` section in `README.md` (tooling, versions, setup commands).
- Keep `README.md` run guidance concise and current for local automated tests, simulator runs, and physical iPhone runs.
- For any active plan document, mark tasks `In Progress` when started.
- Keep active plan documents current with completed and blocked task status so work is resumable.
- Do not make changes outside this repository.
- Make small, focused git commits as milestones are completed.
